                            As a computer programmer since highschool, Zach loves to code. Straight out of college Zach was immediately immersed in the fast-paced agency life of Chicago, IL, USA. The focus was eCommerce and the tech-stack was ASP.NET MVC. He specialized in checkout flows and integrating with cleint PIM systems. Some of the cooler clients were Sram Bicycles (public and B2B), Restek.com, and Flir.com.

                            Fast-forward to present day and the main change is that the stack is now .NET Core. In addition, he has picked up specialties in Elastic Search, Node.js, and React; in addition to being familiar with additional front-end architectures. Check out his résumé <a href="ZachGraceffa_Resume.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

                            Zach is also heavily interested in Web3 technologies. As a buzzword spewer and veteran in the Web3 space he is famous for saying "I am in it for the fundementals," "I want to join a DAO," and "I am addicted to Instagram." He is actively trying to transition into working with Web3 technologies and is doing so by completing tutorials in Solidity and looking to pursue a career in the space.
