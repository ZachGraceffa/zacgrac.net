                    As a computer programmer since highschool, Zach loves to code. Straight out of college Zach was immediately immersed in the fast-paced agency life of Chicago, IL, USA. The focus was eCommerce and the tech-stack was ASP.NET MVC. He specialized in checkout flows and integrating with cleint PIM systems. Some of the cooler clients were Sram Bicycles (public and B2B), Restek.com, and Flir.com.

                <p>
                    Fast-forward to present day and the main change is that the stack is now .NET Core. In addition, he has picked up specialties in Elastic Search, Node.js, and React. He is also familiar with other front-end architectures.

                <p>
                    Zach is also heavily interested in Web3 technologies. As a buzzword spewer and veteran in the Web3 space he is famous for saying "I am in it for the fundementals," "I want to join a DAO," and "I am addicted to Instagram." He is actively trying to transition into working with Web3 technologies and is doing so by completing tutorials in Solidity and pursuing a career in the space.

                    In his personal life Zach enjoys building furniture. He has found joy in working with wood and foam alike and has created pieces ranging from bed-frames to coffee tables to liquor cabinets. Recently, he has secured a gig at a furniture studio in Chicago where he focuses on finishing hardwood pieces.
